Two different implementations are used by bridge.c and bridgeOne.c.
Both solved the problem of starvation.

IMPORTANT: Please use the bridge.c as the one to grade as I think
	   my implementation of bridge.c is better.

bridge.c: Two condition variables are used. One for cars to Hanover,
	  and the other one for cars to Norwich.

bridgeOne.c: Only one condition variable is used.

The way to avoid starvation is to calculate the number of cars goes
to one direction. If this number is above a threshod and there are
cars waiting to go the opposite direction, we will change the allowed
direction on the bridge.

Input: Please provide the max number of cars on bridge, number of
       cars to Norwich, and number of cars to Hanover.
       eg. ./bridge 3 25 1

Output: Once there is a car going on the bridge, a new line will be
	printed to update the information.
